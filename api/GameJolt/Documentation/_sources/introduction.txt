Introduction
============

After releasing my first game on Game Jolt's website, I wanted to test this
cool API that could set achievments and lots of data to complement the user's
experience. But since my intention was on developing using python due it's 
simplicity as yet powerful language, the first thing that I searched was a 
support for it and then I found none. From there, came my iniciative to write
this module, not only for supporting my future game but to provide to the
community something simple that could be re-used without modifications. Of
course that, being an open-source code, anyone can change the lines.
And if a feature is implemented and is in coercion with the module's purpose,
I would like to include it on the official github repository, so everyone can
enjoy it. And I hope that you could find it useful as well!
Thanks!
