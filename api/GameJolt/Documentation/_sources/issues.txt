Known Issues and Bugs
=====================

Here is a list of issues known by me, to keep track of what problems is present
on the API version.

- The blankspace character
	Some methods on the API requires that a string is passed as an argument. These arguments is for storing not only a single word, but an entire text, according to the wishes of the user. 
	For the first release, it won't be supported this blank character. But if you want it anyways, you can write your text replacing the blank spaces by a '+' character. It will work just fine for the API and won't give you a signature error.
	Sorry for this, it was bit of a rush to think on a good way to solve this. Youcan expect this being fixed even on the minor update of the module.
