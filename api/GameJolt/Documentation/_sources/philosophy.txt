Module's Philosophy
===================

The philosophy of this module is to be general. And what do I mean by that?
The Python interpreter bundle come with features and a Standart Library, so
anyone using the same version have the same range of functionalities, if you
consider a "clean" bundle with no additional intallations. So to maintain
compatiblity and portability, I didn't use any outsider modules.
