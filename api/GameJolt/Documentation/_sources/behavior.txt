Behavior
============

This module provide a single Class named GameJoltTrophy. All API calls 
necessary are included as methods of this class.
I found it to be more simple than creating functions alone because the object 
itself carries variables that are always reused. The 'URL' variable, for 
exemple, are almost the same, varying only in the end. Trough this approach, 
the code is smaller and easier to understand, incluiding being more easy
to maintain.
